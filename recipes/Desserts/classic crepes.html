    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>140g plain flour</li>
            <li>200ml whole milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>25g unsalted butter, melted, plus a little extra for greasing</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a medium-size bowl and make
                a well in the middle. Mix the milk and 100ml of water together. Break the
                eggs into the well and start whisking slowly. add the milk
                and water in a steady stream, whisking constantly and
                gradually incorporating the flour as you do so.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk until the batter is smooth and all the flour has been incorporated.
                Set the batter aside to rest for 30mins, then whisk the melted butter into
                the batter.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat the pan over a medium heat. avery lightly grease the pan with melted
                butter. Using a ladle, pour roughly 2 tbsp of batter into the pan and swirl 
                it around so the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. You want to use just
                enough batter to make a delicate, lacy pancake. Cook the pancake for about
                45 secs on one side until golden and then using palette knife or fish slice, 
                flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 30 secs until it
                freckles.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Slide the pancake out of the pan and either serve immediately or stack on
                a plate with baking parchment in between. Continue until all the baâ€ ter is 
                used up.</li>

        </ol>
